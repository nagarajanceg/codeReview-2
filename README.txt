Excellence justification:

We chose fingerprint authentication process which is usually day to day real time activities. On code reviewing this module give us more insight about how the authentication take place. We reviewed the code in more detail. The challenge we face like identifying singleton pattern used in the fingerprintutills Instance and how it's get benefitted. And escpecially multi threading implements along with locks to synchronize the task inorder. We hope this is great learning for us. 

There is a TASKS.doc available which contains explanation for the task provided along with UML class diagram
